A rust battleship game on CLI based on the classic game Battleships.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to use all I have learnt in the rust book and then use this game as a means to learn how to use runtime on different platforms and build architectures

1. CLI based game
1. Mobile and Desktop based game using Flutter, FFI, Protobuf and tokio many more ....
1. Web assembly build on the web.
1. Substrate pallet, Ink contract and blockchain with a runtime to support classic games like this as contracts.
